    <h1>Thomas J. Watson</h1>
    <p>
        American businessman Thomas John Watson Sr., who was born on February 17, 1874, held the positions of chairman and CEO of IBM from the moment he was appointed until his passing on June 19, 1956. He contributed to the development of the company into a powerful force between 1914 and 1956. John Henry Patterson's education at NCR had an impact on Watson as he created the managerial ethos and corporate culture of IBM. He transformed the business into a very effective sales organization that mostly used punched card tabulating equipment. He was a well-known self-made producer who died in 1956 and was recognized as the best salesman in history. He was also one of the richest people in his era.
